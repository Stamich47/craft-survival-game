# 🔧 Sprite Loading Fix Applied

## 🔍 **Issue Identified:**

From the console logs, we discovered that items had `"icon": 1` and `"icon": 2` instead of proper image objects. This indicated React Native Metro bundler was resolving `require()` statements for images to asset IDs (numbers) instead of proper image sources.

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### 1. **Metro Cache Clear**

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

- **Purpose**: Clear Metro bundler cache to force reprocessing of all assets
- **Why**: React Native sometimes caches incorrect image resolutions
- **Result**: Forces fresh processing of all sprite imports

### 2. **Already Fixed Items**

- ✅ **Water**: Added `SPRITE_MAPPING.empty_milk_bottle` icon
- ✅ **Rope**: Added `SPRITE_MAPPING.fibers` icon
- ✅ **77/77 items** have icon properties assigned

### 3. **Asset Structure Verified**

- ✅ **121 sprite files** exist in `/src/assets/sprites/`
- ✅ **SPRITE_MAPPING** properly references all sprites
- ✅ **Items.ts** correctly uses `SPRITE_MAPPING` references
- ✅ **InventorySlot.tsx** properly handles image sources

## 🎯 **Expected Results After Cache Clear:**

**Previously showing as squares:**

- ❌ **Wood** → ✅ Should show wood sprite (sprite_000.png)
- ❌ **Wooden Plank** → ✅ Should show plank sprite (sprite_001.png)
- ❌ **Stick** → ✅ Should show stick sprite (sprite_002.png)
- ❌ **Bone** → ✅ Should show bone sprite (sprite_003.png)

## 🔄 **How Metro Cache Clear Fixes This:**

1. **Before**: `require("./sprites/sprite_001.png")` → `1` (asset ID number)
2. **After**: `require("./sprites/sprite_001.png")` → `{uri: "blob:...", width: 24, height: 24}` (proper image object)

## 🎮 **Test Your Game Now:**

1. Open the app on your device/simulator
2. Check inventory items for proper sprites
3. All items should show graphics instead of letter squares
4. Craft items should also show proper sprites when created

**The Metro cache clear should resolve the sprite loading issue! 🎉**

## 📱 **If Issue Persists:**

- Try reloading the app (press 'r' in terminal)
- Check if specific sprites are missing
- Verify no TypeScript/build errors in console
