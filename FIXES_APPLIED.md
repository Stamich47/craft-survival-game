# ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed

## âœ… **1. Babel Plugin Warning Fixed**

**Issue**:

```
[Reanimated] react-native-reanimated/plugin moved to react-native-worklets/plugin
```

**Solution**:

- Created `babel.config.js` with updated plugin name
- Uses `react-native-worklets/plugin` instead of deprecated `react-native-reanimated/plugin`

## âœ… **2. Persistent Data Issue Fixed**

**Issue**: Old items were still persisting despite version bump

**Solution Applied**:

- Added temporary code to manually clear AsyncStorage on app load
- This will force a complete fresh start
- After the data is cleared once, you should remove this code

## ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Results**:

1. **No more Babel warnings** - The reanimated plugin warning should be gone
2. **Fresh game state** - All old items with broken sprites will be cleared
3. **Proper sprite loading** - New items should show correct graphics
4. **Clean start** - Only the intended starting items will appear

## ðŸ”„ **Next Steps**:

1. **Load your game** - You should see "ðŸ”„ Clearing all game data..." in logs
2. **Reload the app** after seeing "âœ… Game data cleared"
3. **Check inventory** - Should have fresh items with proper sprites
4. **Let me know** if you want me to remove the temporary clearing code
