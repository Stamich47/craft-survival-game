# 🛠️ Asset Corruption Fix

## 🔍 **Problem Identified:**

- **Wood** showing placeholder instead of wood sprite
- **Beef** showing honey icon instead of beef sprite

## 🚀 **Quick Fixes to Try:**

### **1. Clear Metro Cache (Most Likely Fix):**

```bash
# Stop the current expo process first (Ctrl+C)
npx expo start --clear
```

### **2. Clear All Caches:**

```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm start -- --reset-cache

# Or if using Expo CLI
expo r -c
```

### **3. Full Reset (Nuclear Option):**

```bash
# Delete node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npx expo start --clear
```

### **4. Force App Refresh:**

- Force close the app completely
- Reopen the app
- The assets should reload properly

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**

This is likely a **Metro bundler caching issue** where:

- Asset mappings got cached incorrectly during our world system changes
- Old asset references are being served instead of current ones
- Bundle cache has stale asset paths

## ✅ **Expected Result:**

After clearing cache:

- **Wood** → Shows wood sprite (sprite_000.png) ✅
- **Beef** → Shows beef sprite (sprite_078.png) ✅
- **Honey** → Shows honey sprite (sprite_077.png) ✅

## 🎯 **Why This Happened:**

During our world system cleanup, Metro bundler may have cached old asset references. This is a common React Native issue when asset mappings change.

**The asset mapping in code is correct** - it's just a cache issue!

Try the Metro cache clear first - that should fix it immediately! 🚀
