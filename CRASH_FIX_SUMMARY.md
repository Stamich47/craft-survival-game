# 🛠️ iPhone Crash Fix - Performance Optimizations

## ❌ What Was Causing the Crash:

- **Default world type** was PROCEDURAL (expensive generation)
- **Large tile arrays** being generated (20x20+ with complex calculations)
- **Memory-intensive** noise generation on startup
- **Blocking main thread** with heavy computations

## ✅ Fixes Applied:

### 1. **Safe Default World**

- Changed default to `CUSTOM_WORLD` instead of `PROCEDURAL`
- Custom world is pre-loaded, no generation needed
- Set `isLoaded: true` by default

### 2. **Generation Limits**

- Limited procedural world size to max 15x15
- Reduced default size from 20x20 to 10x10
- Added safety checks to prevent oversized worlds

### 3. **Conditional Rendering**

- Custom world renders independently (no tiles array dependency)
- Prevents waiting for complex tile generation
- Other worlds only render when properly loaded

### 4. **Startup Optimization**

- Disabled auto-generation on app startup
- Custom world loads immediately
- No blocking operations on mount

## 🎮 Result:

- **App should start instantly** with your custom world
- **No crashes** from memory overload
- **Smooth performance** on iPhone
- **Your visual editor world** loads immediately

## 🚀 To Test:

1. **Generate placeholder tiles** using `generate-placeholder-tiles.html`
2. **Place tiles** in asset directories
3. **Launch app** - should start with Custom world by default
4. **No more crashes!** ✨

Your custom world from the visual editor is now the safe, fast default experience!
