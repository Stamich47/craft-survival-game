# ðŸŽ® Custom World Integration - Quick Start Guide

## âœ… What I Just Fixed:

- **Disabled complex sprite sheet system** that was causing bundling errors
- **Your custom world from the visual editor** is now the main focus
- **All asset loading errors** should now be resolved

## ðŸš€ To Test Your Custom World:

### Step 1: Generate Placeholder Tiles (Quick Test)

1. Open `generate-placeholder-tiles.html` in your browser
2. Click **"Generate ALL Tiles"** - downloads 12 colored PNG files
3. Move files to correct folders:
   - **Grass tiles** â†’ `src/assets/world-one/tiles/grass/`
   - **Cliff tiles** â†’ `src/assets/world-one/tiles/cliff/`

### Step 2: Test Your Game

1. Run `npm start` or `npx expo start`
2. Click the **"Custom"** button in the game
3. **Your world from the visual editor should appear!** ðŸŽ‰

### Step 3: Use Your Real Tiles (Later)

Replace the placeholder tiles with your actual beautiful PNG tiles using the same filenames.

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Custom World Features:

âœ… **Exact layout** from your visual world editor  
âœ… **Proper grass border** with cliff bottom row  
âœ… **Click-to-move** player movement  
âœ… **Collision detection** on cliff tiles  
âœ… **Spawn point** at (2,2) as configured  
âœ… **Isometric 3D rendering** for beautiful visuals

## ðŸ“‹ Your World Layout (Reminder):

```
Row 0: [Grass Corner, Grass Top, Grass Top, Grass Top, Grass Top, Grass Corner]
Row 1: [Grass Left, Grass, Grass, Grass, Grass, Grass Corner]
Row 2: [Grass Left, Grass, Grass, Grass, Grass Right, Cliff]
Row 3: [Grass Left, Grass, Grass, Grass, Grass, Grass Corner]
Row 4: [Grass Corner, Grass Bottom, Grass Bottom, Grass Bottom, Grass Bottom, Grass Corner]
Row 5: [Cliff, Cliff, Cliff, Cliff, Cliff, Cliff]
```

This is **YOUR** world design from the visual editor - now fully integrated and playable! ðŸŒŸ

The bundling errors should be gone, and you can focus on testing your beautiful custom world design.
