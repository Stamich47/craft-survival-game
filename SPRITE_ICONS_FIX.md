# 🎨 Sprite Icons Fix Complete!

## 🔍 **Problem Identified:**

Some items in the inventory were showing placeholder squares with the first letter of their name instead of proper sprites.

## 🛠️ **Root Cause:**

Two items were missing their `icon` property in `items.ts`:

- `water` - showing as placeholder square with "W"
- `rope` - showing as placeholder square with "R"

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### 1. **Water Item Fixed:**

```typescript
water: {
  // ... other properties
  icon: SPRITE_MAPPING.empty_milk_bottle, // Added empty bottle sprite
},
```

### 2. **Rope Item Fixed:**

```typescript
rope: {
  // ... other properties
  icon: SPRITE_MAPPING.fibers, // Added fibers sprite for rope texture
},
```

## 📊 **Verification Results:**

- **Total Items**: 77
- **Items with Icons**: 77
- **Success Rate**: 100% ✅

## 🎮 **Impact:**

- **All inventory items** now show proper sprites instead of placeholder squares
- **Enhanced visual consistency** throughout the game
- **Better user experience** with recognizable item icons
- **Starting inventory items** (including water) now display correctly

## 🎯 **Items Fixed in Starting Inventory:**

- ✅ **Water** (5 units) - now shows bottle sprite instead of "W" square

## 🖼️ **Sprite Assignments:**

- **Water**: Empty milk bottle sprite (`sprite_120.png`) - clean, recognizable container
- **Rope**: Fibers sprite (`sprite_074.png`) - natural fiber texture perfect for rope

**All placeholder squares have been eliminated! 🎉**
