# Custom World Setup Guide

## 🎮 Your Custom World is Ready!

I've successfully integrated your visual world editor output into the game. Here's what's been set up:

### ✅ What's Already Done:

1. **Custom World Data** (`src/data/customWorld.ts`)

   - Your exact tile layout and configuration
   - Asset imports for all 12 tiles
   - Collision detection for cliff tiles
   - Helper functions for tile management

2. **Custom World Renderer** (`src/components/game/CustomTileWorld.tsx`)

   - Isometric rendering of your custom world
   - Player movement with click-to-move
   - Collision prevention on cliff tiles
   - Proper depth sorting and positioning

3. **Game Integration** (`src/screens/VoxelGameScreen.tsx`)

   - Added "Custom" world button
   - Integrated custom world into world switching system
   - Player spawns at your configured spawn point (2,2)

4. **Asset Directories Created:**
   - `src/assets/world-one/tiles/grass/` (for your 9 grass tiles)
   - `src/assets/world-one/tiles/cliff/` (for your 3 cliff tiles)

### 📂 Next Steps - Add Your PNG Files:

Copy your PNG files to the appropriate directories with these exact names:

#### Grass Tiles (src/assets/world-one/tiles/grass/):

- `grass_top_left_corner.png`
- `grass_top_middle.png`
- `grass_top_right_corner.png`
- `grass_left_middle.png`
- `grass.png`
- `grass_bottom_right_corner.png`
- `grass_right_middle.png`
- `grass_bottom_left_corner.png`
- `grass_bottom_middle.png`

#### Cliff Tiles (src/assets/world-one/tiles/cliff/):

- `cliff_bottom_right.png`
- `cliff_bottom_left.png`
- `cliff_bottom_middle.png`

### 🎮 How to Test:

1. Add your PNG files to the directories above
2. Launch the game with `npm start` or `npx expo start`
3. Click the "Custom" button in the game
4. You should see your custom world rendered!
5. Click tiles to move the character around
6. Cliff tiles will block movement

### 🛠️ Features Included:

- **Visual World Editor** (`world-editor.html`) - Drag & drop tile editor
- **Isometric Rendering** - Beautiful 3D-like perspective
- **Click-to-Move** - Click any walkable tile to move
- **Collision Detection** - Can't walk on cliff tiles
- **Spawn Point** - Character starts at position (2,2)
- **World Switching** - Switch between all world types
- **Asset Management** - Proper PNG loading and caching

### 🎨 Customization Options:

The custom world system supports:

- Any 6x6 tile layout
- Different spawn points
- Custom tile types and collision rules
- Easy integration of new tile sets

Just use the world editor to create new designs and generate the code!

### 🚀 Ready to Play!

Your custom world is fully integrated and ready to test. The combination of the visual editor and the game engine gives you a complete tile-based world creation system.

Have fun exploring your custom world! 🌟
