# 🗡️ Weapon Sprite Integration Complete!

## ✅ What We've Accomplished:

### 1. **Perfect Weapon Extraction**

- **20 weapons extracted** from weapons.png sprite sheet
- **Perfect 32×32 pixel size** using transparency block coordinates
- **4 tiers × 5 weapon types**:
  - **Copper** (Common) - Row 1
  - **Silver** (Uncommon) - Row 2
  - **Gold** (Rare) - Row 3
  - **Diamond** (Legendary) - Row 4
- **5 weapon types**: Sword, Shovel, Pickaxe, Axe, Scythe

### 2. **Game Integration**

- **WEAPON_SPRITE_MAPPING** added to assets/index.ts
- **20 new weapon items** added to items.ts with proper:
  - Names, descriptions, rarities
  - Values balanced by tier (Copper: 20-25, Silver: 40-50, Gold: 80-100, Diamond: 160-200)
  - Proper item types (WEAPON vs TOOL)
  - Sprite icons linked to extracted weapons

### 3. **Crafting System**

- **Weapon recipes** added to recipes.ts
- **Copper tier**: Uses copper ingots + sticks (Level 2, 6-10 seconds)
- **Silver tier**: Uses silver ingots + hardwood (Level 4, 12-15 seconds)
- **Progression-based crafting** with appropriate level requirements

### 4. **Starting Inventory Enhanced**

- Players now start with **5 awesome weapons** to showcase sprites:
  - Copper Sword (basic combat)
  - Copper Pickaxe (mining)
  - Silver Axe (wood chopping)
  - Gold Scythe (crop harvesting)
  - Diamond Shovel (ultimate digging)

### 5. **Recipe Discovery**

- Basic weapon recipes automatically discovered
- Players can immediately craft copper and silver weapons
- Perfect integration with existing crafting system

## 🎮 Ready to Play!

- **141 sprite-based items** (121 resources + 20 weapons)
- **4-tier weapon progression system**
- **Visual weapon sprites** in inventory
- **Balanced crafting recipes**

```

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Test in game** - weapons should appear with sprites in inventory
2. **Add gold/diamond recipes** if desired (currently copper/silver implemented)
3. **Extract smaller weapons** from bottom of sprite sheet if wanted
4. **Balance weapon stats** for combat system
5. **Add weapon durability** system if desired

**The weapon sprites are perfectly extracted and fully integrated! 🎉**
