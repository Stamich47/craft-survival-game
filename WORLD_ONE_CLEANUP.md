# 🧹 System Cleanup Complete - World One Focus

## ✅ **Removed Procedural Generation Completely:**

### **What Got Removed:**

- ❌ `WorldType.PROCEDURAL` enum value
- ❌ `generateWorld()` reducer (complex noise generation)
- ❌ "Procedural" world button
- ❌ `regenerateWorld()` and `forceNewWorld()` functions
- ❌ "New World" buttons that caused crashes

### **Renamed & Reorganized:**

- ✅ `CUSTOM_WORLD` → `WORLD_ONE` (your 6x6 design)
- ✅ "Custom" button → "**World One**" button
- ✅ Old "World One" → "**Legacy World**" button
- ✅ Default world is now `WORLD_ONE` (loads instantly)

## 🎯 **Current World Options:**

### 1. **World One** (Default - Your Design)

- Your 6x6 custom layout from visual editor
- Grass borders with cliff bottom row
- Top-down square grid (not diamond)
- Loads instantly, no crashes

### 2. **Basic 6x6**

- Simple test world with placeholders
- For basic functionality testing

### 3. **Legacy World**

- Old flat world system (if needed)
- Complex sprite sheet approach

## 🎮 **What This Means:**

**Starting the Game:**

- App opens directly to **World One** (your custom design)
- No loading screens or generation delays
- No crash-prone procedural calculations
- Clean, focused experience

**Button Layout:**

```
[Basic 6x6] [Legacy World] [World One] ← Your main world
```

## 🚀 **Benefits:**

- ✅ **No more crashes** from procedural generation
- ✅ **Instant startup** with World One
- ✅ **Clean interface** focused on your design
- ✅ **Top-down 2D style** instead of isometric diamond
- ✅ **World One is the star** - your visual editor creation

Your World One design is now the main focus of the game! 🌟
